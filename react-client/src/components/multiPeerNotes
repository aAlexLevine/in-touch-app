you need to maintain a peer object for every connection
-so still need two peer creations for every connection, 
  one on initiator side and one on receiver side 
  and they both have to exchange their signal data

every peer object operates on its own 1 to 1 channel
-rather than it being a relay to get the stream and being used to listen for others

(peerjs)peer ids are for the connection, there is one peer id between 2 people
(simple-peer) one initiator, but each end of the peer must signal

i join a room with someone in it
 my joining triggers server to tell all in room i joined 

the person in the room calls me - how 

walkie talkie that can only transmit/recieve on one channel 
 you need a walkie talkie for each person 
 and in turn they need a walkie talkie for each person 

 if you have 3 friends, you need 3 walkie talkies

///////

//i join
  // i emit that i joined pass along my socket id- server relays it to all in room
  // everyone in room calls me - i am the receiver
  //when i receive the call, connect and respond with my signal data from new peer connection

  //set listneer for when someone joins
  //when someone new joins, call them with a peer connection ,you are the initiator

  //outside of peer connection listen for the response from the newly joined, and connect. (peer.signal)
